ODEON is not a free software, but you can download a free trial version from their website[^1^]. The trial version allows you to try all the features available in the software, using the geometries supplied with it. You can also watch some tutorials and examples on how to use ODEON for different purposes.
 
If you want to use ODEON for your own videos, you will need to purchase a license and a dongle from their website. There are different editions and versions of ODEON, depending on your needs and budget. You can compare the features and prices of each edition here. Once you have your license and dongle, you can install ODEON on your computer and start creating your own acoustic simulations.
 
One of the features of ODEON is that it can integrate with SketchUp, a 3D modeling software that allows you to create and edit your own geometries. You can download a free plugin from ODEON's website that enables you to export your SketchUp models to ODEON and import ODEON results back to SketchUp. This way, you can design and optimize your own virtual rooms and auditoriums for online viewing.
 
Another feature of ODEON is that it can work as an HD online player. You can use ODEON to play any video file on your computer or stream online videos from YouTube or other platforms. ODEON will apply the acoustic simulation of your chosen geometry to the audio track of the video, creating a realistic and immersive sound environment. You can adjust the volume, balance, equalizer, and other settings of the audio output according to your preferences.
 
ODEON Acoustic Software is a powerful tool that can help you enjoy HD online videos with realistic and immersive sound. However, it is not a software that you can crack or download illegally. If you want to use ODEON for your own purposes, you will need to purchase a license and a dongle from their website. Otherwise, you can use the free trial version or watch some examples on their website.

ODEON Acoustic Software is not only useful for online videos, but also for other applications that require realistic and accurate sound simulation. For example, you can use ODEON to design and optimize the acoustics of real or planned buildings, such as concert halls, theaters, churches, classrooms, offices, and more. You can also use ODEON to measure and analyze the acoustical properties of existing rooms and spaces, such as reverberation time, sound pressure level, clarity, speech intelligibility, and more.
 
ODEON Acoustic Software is based on the principles of geometrical acoustics and ray tracing. This means that ODEON simulates the sound propagation in a room by tracing the paths of sound rays that reflect and diffract from the surfaces and edges of the room geometry. ODEON also takes into account the absorption and scattering coefficients of the materials and the frequency-dependent characteristics of the sound source and receiver. ODEON can handle complex geometries with curved surfaces, irregular shapes, and multiple rooms.
 
ODEON Acoustic Software is a user-friendly and intuitive software that can be used by anyone who is interested in sound and acoustics. You do not need to have any prior knowledge or experience in acoustics or physics to use ODEON. You can easily create and edit your own geometries or import them from SketchUp or other CAD software. You can also choose from a library of predefined materials, sources, receivers, and settings. You can visualize the sound field in 3D or 2D graphs and maps, listen to auralizations and impulse responses, and export your results to various formats.
